# Gastrectomy Project Data Analysis

## Taxonomic annotations 
Taxonomic annotations were carried out using two different tools named [mOTU](https://motu-tool.org/) and [MetaPhlan2](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/metaphlan2/src/default/)

### mOTU


### MetaPhlan2
For annotations using MetaPhlan2, please see the HUMAnN2 part in the Functional annotations

## Functional annotations
Functional annotations were carried out in our in house pipeline (KEGG-based) and [HUMAnN2](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/humann2/wiki/Home)

### KEGG-based


### HUMAnN2

Custom scripts for runing in SGE system:  `HUMAnN2_pipeline.sh`.
For runing the scripts you need to specify
The format of the high quality reads should be `Sample_ID.samenames.fastq` or `Sample_ID.samenames.fastq.gz`
* `$1` : Sample ID
* `$2` : directory for the output
* `$3` : directory for the high quality reads

Example usage

```bash
qsub -l mem=4G -pe smp 8 HUMAnN2_pipeline.sh <sequence_id> <directory_out> <directory_in>
```


## Other annotations
### Oral microbes

### Phenotype annotations (BugBase)


### Microbe-Metabolite (MIMOSA)



## Data analysis custom scripts

### Statistics
* **LEfSe**

The differences in microbiome features (taxonomy, KO modules) relative abundance were calculated by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size [LEfSe](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/lefse). LEfSe first identifies features that are statistically different between healthy and gastrectomy groups using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis sum-rank test (P≤0.05). We modified the default calculation by controlling the multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) correction procedure. All of the modification can be found in `LEfSe_Modif`

* **MaAsLin**

The associations coefficient (variance explained) between the demographic data (groups, age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption status, and BMI) as explanatory variables and the detected microbial features as response were tested by the [MaAsLin R package](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/maaslin/src/default/).
